  abstract     = {A revolution in education and technology transfer will follow from the marriage of word processing and software command scripts. In this marriage, here being called an active document (a-doc), an author attaches to every figure caption a pushbutton or a name tag usable to recalculate the figure from from all its data, parameters, and programs. An a-doc
provides a concrete definition of reproducibility in computational oriented research. Given suitable interactive software, an active document is easily converted into an interactive document (i-doc). I have two textbooks undergoing conversion to i-books.},
